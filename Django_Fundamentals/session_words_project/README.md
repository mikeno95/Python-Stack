# Session Words Assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to use forms and sessions in Django, specifically to get familiar with use of radio buttons and checkboxes. 
<br>
The requirements were: 
* Create a new app called 'session_words'
* Allow the user to add any new word to the session
* The user should be able to specify the color to display the word and whether the word is in a bigger font
* The user should be able to clear the session
* Show the words stored in the session on the right

I have also added error messages in case the user doesn't input a word or select a color.
