# Dojo Survey with Validation 
The purpose of this assignment was to create a survey page using Flask that accepts a form submission, validates the user's inputs, redirects, and presents the submitted data on a results page. The goal was to practice using Flash for validation, and getting familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. 

The survey contains the following inputs: 
* Name
* Dojo Location 
* Favorite language
* Comment box 

The following are the validations:
* Name field cannot be blank
* Dojo Location and Favorite Language must be chosen
* Comment box must be less than 120 characters
